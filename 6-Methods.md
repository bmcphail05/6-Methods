6 - Research Methods

We do "research" all the time (i.e., online reviews, Google).

What's the difference between Googling something at sociological research?

# SLIDE - sociology definition
Remember our definition?

The words "scientific" and "systematic" underlines the key difference between this kind of research and an online search.

A sociologist uses a system, or a formal process through which we gather data. An online search is typically not systematic.

Sociological research is the creation of "knowledge." Have you ever thought about where knowledge comes from? Researchers have to study something and figure. How do we know what we know?

Patterns not definitive explanations.

Quantitative research techniques like survey research are extremely effective at exploring, describing, and explaining social forces in very large groups, even whole populations. Indeed most of the best nationally representative survey research is done with surprisingly small sample sizes. (this works, but must take stats).

A carefully constructed quantitative study of love can tell us how prevalent this phenomenon is in the US population, its relationship to important demographic and social characteristics of the population, and even something about the attitudes and behaviors related to the phenomenon.

2. Pair Up
Students are to interview on another. Each must take notes. Ask them to conduct an interview exploring the question “what is love?”  

Conclude the interview period and give students a moment or two to reflect on their notes. Then ask for volunteers to report on what was learned. Record key words and short phrases from these brief reports on the board. Emphasize that this material is data. Continue collecting and recording key words and phrases on the board until the data becomes saturated, that is until new and novel entries begin to taper off. Encourage students to add anything else not already included in the data set.  

coding this data by asking them to organize key words and phrases into categories or dimensions based on their similarity.

Point out the incredibly rich and detailed knowledge that the class has generated about the research topic. Love is something most everyone knows something about. But, now the class has unearthed a multidimensional and perhaps contradictory set of cultural meanings condensed in the concept. Love is an important part of our culture. But its meaning is contextual and contingent. Describe how in-depth interviewing as a research technique is well suited to exploring, describing, explaining meaning systems in rich detail.


# Conclusion
Summarize this exercise by explaining how quantitative techniques, here exemplified by survey research, are very powerful tools for gathering targeted information from very large populations. However, the research must carefully specify in advance how the topic under investigation is to be measured. This work often proceeds deductively as the researcher draws on existing scholarship and theorizing to craft good measures.  

Qualitative techniques, here exemplified by the in-depth interview, are very powerful tools for capturing meanings and nuances, but from relatively smaller subsets of a population. The work often proceeds inductively as the researcher moves from the accounts of experiences of people in a social world to sensitizing concepts and theory about those social worlds.
